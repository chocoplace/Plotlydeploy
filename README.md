# **Belly_Button_Biodiversity**

## Overview of the analysis: 
Create a webpage in HTML where a dynamic dashboard presents the findings of the research of the relation to beef and bacteria. The confidential data is available for research participants and fellow researchers. The data will be presented with anonymity to respect the identity of those involved. Participants can check their results with their ID number. Researchers have the opportunity to see the results on different visual presentations. 

### Resources

Software: VS Code, JavaScript, Plotly, D3.js and HTML. 

### Results:

- Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. The horizontal bar chart displays the sample_values as the values, the otu_ids as the labels, and the otu_labels as the hover text for the bars on the chart.

- Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard. The dashboard can be acces through Github pages: https://chocoplace.github.io/Plotlydeploy/
  -  The webpage has three customizations:
    -  Add an image to the jumbotron.
    -  Add background color or a variety of compatible colors to the webpage.
    -  Change the layout of the page.
    -  Use a custom font with contrast for the colors.
  -  When the dashboard is first opened in a browser, ID 940’s data should be displayed in the dashboard, and all three charts should be working according to the requirements when a sample is selected from the dropdown menu.
